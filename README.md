%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  The Marksmanship Tracker %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Version Short Victorious War

I got tired of trying to track game sessions for Marksmanship awards using Excel and was going bug crazy from the panademic so I decided to create this app.

There's no fancy installation thing, just unzip to a folder on your hard drive and double click on MarksmanshipTracker.exe to start it going.

First step: Add your ship. Go to the Ships page and add your ship to the list.

Second step:  Add your crew. Go to the People page to add manually or import from a CSV file. (See PeopleImport.csv the format needed.)

Third Step: Add the games. I've included the games we play on the HMS Demon and HMS Vixen.

Now you are ready to go the Session page where you enter the game play sessions.

Game time is recorded in minutes. The app will convert to hours, calculate multipliers and record the credits for each crewmember.

The Reports page will show you the logs, let you see how many credits your crew has accumulated, and present a list of awards won.

You can export any of the reports to CSV file by clicking export next to the report.

The exported GameSessionLog can be sent upcommand to your Triad or to the Fleet Range Officer to be imported into their local copy of logged sessions.

To import a GameSessionLog you've received:
 Make a copy of the file TrackerData.db to backup your local records  (very much recommended)
 Go to the Session Page and click on Import Sessions. Select the file you received and click Ok.
